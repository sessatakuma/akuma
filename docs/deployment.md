# Deployment & Local Setup

Internal development and operations notes for AkuMa.

## Local API Setup

Production on Cloudflare manages the upstream API key server-side.

If you run the app locally, the Next.js route handler for `/api/mark-accent/stream`
needs an API key in `.env`:

```bash
MARK_ACCENT_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

`.env` is picked up on `process.env` both by `bun dev` and by `bun run preview`
(the Workers runtime), so one file covers both local modes.

## Deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

The app is deployed to **Cloudflare Workers** using the
[`@opennextjs/cloudflare`](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) adapter.

Useful scripts:

```bash
bun run preview   # build with OpenNext + run locally on the Workers runtime
bun run deploy    # build + deploy to Cloudflare from your machine
```

### Continuous deployment (Workers Builds)

CD is handled by **Cloudflare Workers Builds** (connect this Git repo in the
Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → the `akuma` Worker → Settings → Builds):

- **Build command:** `bunx opennextjs-cloudflare build`
- **Deploy command (production):** `npx wrangler deploy --keep-vars`
- **Version command (non-production branches):** `npx wrangler versions upload`
- **Production branch:** `main` (other branches upload preview versions)

`--keep-vars` stops each deploy from wiping runtime vars/secrets set in the
dashboard, since they are not declared in `wrangler.jsonc`.

### Cloudflare routing

| Host                            | Source                                    | Behaviour                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `akuma.sessatakuma.dev`         | `custom_domain: true` in `wrangler.jsonc` | Production origin (Worker = sole origin).                                                               |
| `accent-marker.sessatakuma.dev` | `custom_domain: true` in `wrangler.jsonc` | Bound to the same Worker; middleware 301-redirects to `akuma.sessatakuma.dev`, preserving path + query. |
| `<version>-akuma.*.workers.dev` | `preview_urls`                            | Per-version preview deployments for non-`main` branches. Auto-tagged `noindex` via middleware.          |

`custom_domain: true` tells Cloudflare to provision the required DNS record and
managed TLS certificate automatically when the Worker is first deployed — no
manual DNS setup is required for the two in-repo hosts.

The legacy-host 301 redirect is implemented in `src/middleware.ts` (Edge
runtime) rather than a Cloudflare Redirect Rule so the routing table stays
declarative in the repo and survives across accounts/zones.

### Secrets & environment variables

Runtime (dashboard → the Worker → Settings → Variables, or `wrangler secret put`):

| Name                       | Type   | Required | Notes                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `MARK_ACCENT_API_KEY`      | Secret | Yes      | Upstream API key for the stream proxy. |
| `MARK_ACCENT_UPSTREAM_URL` | Var    | No       | Overrides the default upstream URL.    |

Build-time (dashboard → Settings → Builds → Build variables), inlined at build:

| Name                                | Required | Notes                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CF_BEACON_TOKEN`       | No       | Cloudflare Web Analytics token; the beacon is injected only on the production host if set.          |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MS_CLARITY_PROJECT_ID` | No       | Microsoft Clarity project ID; loaded only on the production host after a visitor accepts analytics. |

## Microsoft Clarity consent

Clarity is globally opt-in. The production site does not load Clarity until a visitor accepts
analytics, and an accepted session grants analytics storage while keeping advertising storage denied.

Before enabling `NEXT_PUBLIC_MS_CLARITY_PROJECT_ID` in Workers Builds:

1. Review the [Privacy & Cookie Policy](/privacy) content and the intended audience.
2. In Clarity, enable Consent Mode so the project also respects consent signals.
3. Rebuild the production branch after changing the build variable.

Visitors can reject analytics or change their choice using the control in the site footer. This
preference is stored locally in their browser; withdrawing consent reloads the page so Clarity is
not loaded again. The text input and analysis result also use Clarity element-level masking.
