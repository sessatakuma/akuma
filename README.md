# AkuMa

A web tool for automatic Japanese furigana and accent markings to plain text, to help Japanese learners to improve their speaking and reading skills.

## What It Does

- Analyzes Japanese text and renders furigana with pitch-accent markings automatically
- Lets you click the generated result to adjust furigana and accent output manually
- Supports plain-text copy, Markdown export, and image download for study notes

## How It Works

1. Paste or generate a Japanese sentence.
2. Let the app analyze and mark the text.
3. Tweak furigana or accent presentation directly in the result panel if needed.
4. Export the formatted output in the format you need.

## Quick Start (Internal Development)

Install dependencies with [bun](https://bun.com/):

```bash
bun i
```

Start the local dev server:

```bash
bun dev
```

## iOS Development

Update AkuMa on your paired iPhone (USB or wireless):

```bash
bun run iphone
```

This builds a signed app, installs it over the existing app without uninstalling,
and relaunches it. Keep your iPhone unlocked. Use `bun run ios` for the simulator.

The device script uses the Xcode project's signing team. If one isn't configured,
set `APPLE_TEAM_ID` in your environment or in a git-ignored `.env.local` file:

```dotenv
APPLE_TEAM_ID=YOUR_TEAM_ID
```

If multiple iPhones are available, select one with
`IOS_DEVICE_ID=<UDID> bun run iphone`. Find its UDID with
`xcrun devicectl list devices`. Run `bun run iphone --help` for other options.

For signed archives, TestFlight uploads, screenshots, and App Store handoff, see
[the iOS release workflow](docs/ios-release.md). Start with `bun run ios:release --help`.

## Local API Setup (Internal Development)

Production on Cloudflare manages the upstream API key server-side.

If you run the app locally, the Next.js route handler for `/api/mark-accent/stream`
needs an API key in `.env`:

```bash
MARK_ACCENT_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

`.env` is picked up on `process.env` both by `bun dev` and by `bun run preview`
(the Workers runtime), so one file covers both local modes.

## Deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

The app is deployed to **Cloudflare Workers** using the
[`@opennextjs/cloudflare`](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) adapter.

Useful scripts:

```bash
bun run preview   # build with OpenNext + run locally on the Workers runtime
bun run deploy    # build + deploy to Cloudflare from your machine
```

### Continuous deployment (Workers Builds)

CD is handled by **Cloudflare Workers Builds** (connect this Git repo in the
Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → the `akuma` Worker → Settings → Builds):

- **Build command:** `bunx opennextjs-cloudflare build`
- **Deploy command (production):** `npx wrangler deploy --keep-vars`
- **Version command (non-production branches):** `npx wrangler versions upload`
- **Production branch:** `main` (other branches upload preview versions)

`--keep-vars` stops each deploy from wiping runtime vars/secrets set in the
dashboard, since they are not declared in `wrangler.jsonc`.

### Cloudflare routing

The `routes` block is **declared in `wrangler.jsonc` but intentionally
commented out** until the production cutover (see [#117](https://github.com/sessatakuma/AkuMa/issues/117)).
Until then the production hosts keep serving from Vercel and only the
ephemeral `akuma-cf.*` host points at this Worker. Uncommenting the block
in the cutover PR is the one-way door that flips the production CNAME from
Vercel to Cloudflare on the next `main` deploy.

| Host                            | Source                                                                                                                                 | Behaviour                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `akuma.sessatakuma.dev`         | Currently Vercel; cutover in [#117](https://github.com/sessatakuma/AkuMa/issues/117) → `custom_domain: true` in `wrangler.jsonc`       | Production origin (Worker = sole origin).                                                                     |
| `accent-marker.sessatakuma.dev` | Currently Vercel (307); cutover in [#117](https://github.com/sessatakuma/AkuMa/issues/117) → `custom_domain: true` in `wrangler.jsonc` | Bound to the same Worker; middleware 301-redirects to `akuma.sessatakuma.dev`, preserving path + query.       |
| `akuma-cf.sessatakuma.dev`      | Ad-hoc test binding (dashboard)                                                                                                        | Ephemeral. To be torn down post-cutover — tracked in [#116](https://github.com/sessatakuma/AkuMa/issues/116). |
| `*.workers.dev`                 | Cloudflare default (preview deployments)                                                                                               | Workers Builds preview deployments for non-`main` branches. Auto-tagged `noindex` via middleware.             |

`custom_domain: true` tells Cloudflare to provision the required DNS record and
managed TLS certificate automatically when the Worker is first deployed — no
manual DNS setup is required for the two in-repo hosts.

The legacy-host 301 redirect is implemented in `src/middleware.ts` (Edge
runtime) rather than a Cloudflare Redirect Rule so the routing table stays
declarative in the repo and survives across accounts/zones.

### Secrets & environment variables (Cloudflare)

Runtime (dashboard → the Worker → Settings → Variables, or `wrangler secret put`):

| Name                       | Type   | Required | Notes                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `MARK_ACCENT_API_KEY`      | Secret | Yes      | Upstream API key for the stream proxy. |
| `MARK_ACCENT_UPSTREAM_URL` | Var    | No       | Overrides the default upstream URL.    |

Build-time (dashboard → Settings → Builds → Build variables), inlined at build:

| Name                          | Required | Notes                                                                                      |
